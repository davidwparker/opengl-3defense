TODO:
Top 4 issues are probably going to be priority, unless you say otherwise... 
with #1 getting the majority of my focus.

#1) FIX FRAMERATE ISSUE. This Ubuntu/Freeglut thing is haunting me. Since adding shadows and minions, 
whenever I use gluUnProject, some of the times I get a bad Z value (and by some, I mean quite often if
the framerate is higher). By adding a delay (currently ~80-100 ms), then it works, but if I drop down
to ~30 then it doesn't work on my Ubuntu machine. It works perfectly on my Macbook Pro.

If you have time, I would like to meet with you if you have any knowledge of what I could do to fix
this issue.

Gameplay:
#2) Add 'waves' of minions, where a group of minions will go, then X time later, a second wave will go, 
and so on.
#3) Add the ability for the towers to "attack" the minions by shooting things.
#4) By way of #3, add collision detection for those attacks whene hitting the minions.
#5) Ensure that the user earns money for kills, and is able to only buy certain towers.
#6) Provide ability to upgrade towers (example: fire tower becomes advanced fire tower).

Graphics (These would be nice, but probably won't happen considering my timing):
#7) It would be "cool" to have realistic shadows (towers shading each other), but I DON'T think I'll 
be able to get to that.
#8) Clean up the sidebar to add textures, icons for towers (I would have to draw these), icons for
money, lives, etc.
#9) Add pop-ups, etc, on hover-over for icons, etc. to show the statistics of the towers.
#10) Show area of attack for the towers.

 (SOME OF THESE MAY BE WRONG...)

select tower to draw:
0          => none

delete or backspace  => if a tower is selected on screen, then delete it

Mouse interactions:
"Screen" side (left side):
-if a tower is selected:
--left-click:
find the x,y,z position of the mouse and place the object in that position
the object will be reset to 'none' after placing the object
NOTE: only 20 objects may be placed. If you place more than 20, then it starts to 
      replace item 1, 2, etc
--shift+left-click:
same as left click, but object will not be reset to 'none' after click

-if tower selected is 'none', then select a tower on the left side:
--left-click a tower
---press 'delete' or 'backspace' and the tower should be deleted

"Sidebar" side (right side):
-left-click:
--click on a tower name to select it.
if selecting a non-elemental tower, also select a texture to apply:
click on a texture name to select it

NOTE: there are two ways to select a shape: 
 1) keyboard shortcuts
 2) mouse click on shape name
