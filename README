Homework 3 - Lighting and Textures
David Parker

Total time spent on code: ~33 hours
-research (2 hours)
-layout (1 hours)
-objects (4 hours)
--lighting/normals (6 hours)
--textures/material (6 hours)
-object selection (5 hours)
-object deletion (3 hours)
-refactoring, etc (3 hours)
-debugging on Ubuntu (3 hours)

Final notes:
I spent four hours trying to use object selection via GL_RENDER and GL_SELECT, and 
it wasn't working out. I was using the deprecated functionality, which involves
the selection buffer, gluPickMatrix, glInitNames, etc, and I wasn't getting the 
correct values returned to me. Using my mad Google skills, I discovered a different
way to select objects using color coding (thanks to lighthouse3d). After about one
hour working with color coding, I was able to get the basics of it down (with it
selecting the correct item).

Once again, I was having some issues with Ubuntu. I thought gluUnProject was wrong
as it was giving me bad values, but the thing was, it was perfectly okay. Turns out
that Ubuntu has some issues with glutPostRedisplay being constantly called in the
idle function, so I had to add a small delay (why it caused issues with the 
coordinates, I have no idea).

Some interesting things learned:
-For lighting, calculating normals can be a pain (remembering trigonometry)
-Taking a 2D texture and applying it to a 3D object takes work, too
-Object selection is hard
-Ubuntu has some issues with an glutPostRedisplay being constantly called in an
 idle function, so I had to add a delay.

The following interactions are provided:
Keyboard interactions:
Special Keys:
Right      => +5 th angle
Left       => -5 th angle
Up         => +5 ph angle
Down       => -5 ph angle
F3         => Toggle light distance 5 or 2

Regular Keys:
Escape     => close the program
r or R     => reset to original parameters
x or X     => toggle axes on/off (default off)
p or P     => toggle display mode (default projection)
f or F     => toggle draw default objects (must reset "r" after toggling)
v or V     => toggle draw values on bottom of screen
-          => decrease the field of view (for perspective) by 1
+          => increase the field of view (for perspective) by 1
i          => decrease the dimensions by 0.2
I          => increase the dimensions by 0.2
l or L     => toggle light on/off (default on)
m          => toggle light movement (default on)
M          => toggle tops rotate movement (default on)
<          => decrease the light th by 1
>          => increase the light th by 1
[          => decrease the light Y by 0.1
]          => increase the light Y by 0.1
a          => decrease the ambient by 5
A          => increase the ambient by 5
d          => decrease the diffuse by 5
D          => increase the diffuse by 5
s          => decrease the specular by 5
S          => increase the specular by 5
e          => decrease the emission by 5
E          => increase the emission by 5
n          => decrease the shininess by 5
N          => increase the shininess by 5
select tower to draw:
0          => none
1          => fire
2          => advanced fire
3          => ice
4          => advanced ice
5          => earth
6          => advanced earth
7          => poison
8          => advanced poison
9          => toggle through all non-elemental towers 
t          => toggle through all the different textures
w or W     => toggle preview mode (slightly buggy)
delete or backspace  => if a tower is selected on screen, then delete it

Mouse interactions:
"Screen" side (left side):
-if a tower is selected:
--left-click:
find the x,y,z position of the mouse and place the object in that position
the object will be reset to 'none' after placing the object
NOTE: only 20 objects may be placed. If you place more than 20, then it starts to 
      replace item 1, 2, etc
--shift+left-click:
same as left click, but object will not be reset to 'none' after click

-if tower selected is 'none', then select a tower on the left side:
--left-click a tower
---press 'delete' or 'backspace' and the tower should be deleted

"Sidebar" side (right side):
-left-click:
--click on a tower name to select it.
if selecting a non-elemental tower, also select a texture to apply:
click on a texture name to select it

NOTE: there are two ways to select a shape: 
 1) keyboard shortcuts
 2) mouse click on shape name
